        <h3>One Of The Founders Of KFC</h3>
    <p>
        His name is pete harman.
        Leon Weston "Pete" Harman (January 16, 1919 – November 19, 2014) was an American businessman best known for having struck a deal with Colonel Harland Sanders to open the first KFC franchise.
        Located in Salt Lake City, Utah it opened for business in August 1952.
        Harman was born in 1919 in Granger, now a part of West Valley City, a suburb of Salt Lake City, Utah to David Reese Harman (1874–1924) and Grace May Hemenway (1879–1919) . 
        Harman was the youngest of 14 children in a Latter-day Saint family. 
        Harman's mother died two days after he was born, and his father later married Caroline Hemenway Harman, the widow of Pete's uncle. Harman was a major donor to the construction of the Caroline Hemenway Harman Continuing Education Building at Brigham Young University, named after his step-mother.
        Harman and his wife, Arline, opened their first restaurant, The Do Drop Inn, with two employees in 1941. 
        They had met in the 1930s while both employees at the same restaurant in San Francisco, California, and married in 1938.
        Harman worked with Colonel Sanders to develop and prepare the KFC system for franchising, working to develop training manuals and product guides. His other claims to fame are the development of the bucket packaging[3] and the emphasis on the "Finger-lickin' good" motto.
        In 1990 the International Foodservice Manufacturer Association recognized Harman's achievements with its Gold Plate Award. 
        At the time of the award the Harman Management Corp. of Los Altos, California, employed over 4,000 people and operated 238 KFC stores in four states. 
        Credit for his success was given to his enlightened practices towards his staff including stock purchase schemes.
        His original KFC building was demolished in 2004 to make way for a museum and an updated restaurant. 
        Harman relocated to Los Altos, California as the scope of his business expanded in the 1960s. 
        He lived there until his death on November 19, 2014, at 95 years old.

        <h3>The Second Founder Of KFC</h3>
        <p>
         His name is Colonel Sanders.
            Born:9 September 1890, Henryville, Indiana, United States
         Died: 16 December 1980, Louisville, Kentucky, United States
         Full name: Harland David Sanders
         Children: Mildred Sanders Ruggles, Harland Sanders, Jr., Margaret Sanders
            Sanders held a number of jobs in his early life, such as steam engine stoker, insurance salesman and filling station operator. He began selling fried chicken from his roadside restaurant in North Corbin, Kentucky, during the Great Depression. 
            During that time Sanders developed his "secret recipe" and his patented method of cooking chicken in a pressure fryer. 
            Sanders recognized the potential of the restaurant franchising concept, and the first KFC franchise opened in South Salt Lake, Utah in 1952. 
            When his original restaurant closed, he devoted himself full-time to franchising his fried chicken throughout the country.
            The company's rapid expansion across the United States and overseas became overwhelming for Sanders. 
            In 1964, then 73 years old, he sold the company to a group of investors led by John Y. Brown Jr. and Jack C. Massey for $2 million ($16.5 million today). 
            However, he retained control of operations in Canada, and he became a salaried brand ambassador for Kentucky Fried Chicken. 
            In his later years, he became highly critical of the food served by KFC restaurants, as he believed they had cut costs and allowed quality to deteriorate.
            Harland David Sanders was born on September 9, 1890, in a four-room house located 3 miles (5 km) east of Henryville, Indiana.
